Slack Caesar Bot
=============
This bot encrypts and decrypts messages on Slack using the Caesar Cipher. It uses a NLP API to figure out which decrypted message is the correct one, or lists
all 25 options if the message is too short.

I originally created this bot as a joke with coworkers at my Teradata internship as we had an outreach event in which my group taught Cryptography to 80 kids
aged 8-12. While creating the lesson plan, we would send messages to each other encrypted by various easily breakable ciphers.
